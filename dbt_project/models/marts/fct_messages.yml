        # This custom test checks for messages that have text but no media,
        # which might indicate an issue if all messages are expected to have media.
        # Adjust the logic based on your specific business rule.
        # For example, if a message has text, it should not have media if it's a text-only channel.
        # This is a placeholder; define a meaningful business rule.
        # Example: All messages with 'product' in text must have an image.
        # SELECT message_id FROM {{ this }} WHERE message_text ILIKE '%product%' AND NOT has_image
        # For now, a simple example:
        where: "message_text IS NOT NULL AND has_media = FALSE"
        # The actual SQL for the custom test is defined in a separate .sql file in the tests/ directory
        # For example, tests/messages_with_text_and_no_media.sql
